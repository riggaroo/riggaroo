### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rebecca, I'm a Principal Android Engineer at GoDaddy and the Android Guild Lead, currently working on Over, which is a digital design app. I am also a Google Developer Expert for Android.

I've been working on Android for over 8 years and I really enjoy making beautiful Android Apps. You will often find me blogging about Graphics, Animation, Architecture. Before this whole global pandemic thing, I also spoke at conferences and enjoyed travelling the world. Now I'm cooped up at home in Johannesburg, South Africa, awaiting the day this is a reality again.
